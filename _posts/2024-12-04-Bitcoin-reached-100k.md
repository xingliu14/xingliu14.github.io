Bitcoin finally reached $100k today (20241204). I am feeling very excited right now, not because of the unrealized gain on my account, but because the reality is going in the direction I believed it would.

Between 2020 and 2021, I started to realize that Bitcoin and crypto as a whole had passed the turning point that determines its survival, as the consensus reached a certain magnitude that would prevent its demise. Starting from then, I began to DCA into Bitcoin and a few other cryptos. The amount of money is not that impressive and won't change my life, but serves as an anchor into this topic.

I (along with other degens) went through the harsh year of 2022, and finally today we reached the artificial milestone: $100k. This is just the start, yet still many people consider Bitcoin a scam. I am more excited to see how the price increase changes people's views towards Bitcoin.

At some point, maybe Bitcoin will become another tool that the rich use to exploit the poor, but I'm happy to take the early ride in Bitcoin's history.
