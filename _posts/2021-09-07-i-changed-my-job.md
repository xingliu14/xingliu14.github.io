title: "I Changed Job"

Just a quick update. This week will be my last week at Yahoo. Starting from next week I'll be working at Google.

The reason I decided to switch the job is I heard Apollo will acquire Verizon Media, and since Apollo is a private equity company. I don't think Yahoo will thrive as a tech company.

I interviewed with 6 companies: Google (Offer), Robinhood (Offer), LinkedIn (Rejection), Amazon (Rejection), Facebook (Withdraw Onsite), TikTok (Withdraw Onsite).

It was tough to choose between Google and Robinhood. I finally accepted Google's offer based on many reasons. Looking forward to the new journey.
