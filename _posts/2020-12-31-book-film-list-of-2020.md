2020 is surely a unique year, I went through ups and downs, like everyone else. One gem I received is I developed the habit of reading every day, it was tough at first, gradually I started to enjoy it. I'd like to share my favorite books I read in 2020:
<br/><br/>

#### "Le Petit Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
It's a mirror, everyone see his/her own present reflection from the story, that’s why I don’t regret that I didn’t read it when I was younger.
<br/><br/>

#### "Sternstunden der Menschheit：Vierzehn historische Miniaturen" by Stefan Zweig
Fate always changes inadvertently.
<br/><br/>

#### "The Case of the Speluncean Explorers" by Lon L. Fuller
Law is like a giant classifier, and people built it without code.
<br/><br/>

#### "Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping" by Paco Underhill
We make money from other people's shopping, then we go shopping and spend the money. So we'd better know something about the science of shopping.
<br/><br/>

#### "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
I guess it works, now I can read everyday.
<br/><br/>

#### "Principles of Economics" by N. Gregory Mankiw
Finally cleared that reading debt, I prefer the microeconomics part.
<br/><br/>

#### "The Moon and Sixpence" by William Somerset Maugham
He fulfilled his dream, but he is a selfish man.
<br/><br/>

#### "No Longer Human" by Osamu Dazai
The coward is afraid of happiness, and he gets hurt when he touches cotton.
<br/><br/>

#### "Clean Code" by Robert Cecil Martin
(ongoing)
<br/><br/>

#### "The Baron in the Trees" by Italo Calvino
(ongoing)
