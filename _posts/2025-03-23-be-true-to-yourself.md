My pain (as is true for many other people) comes from my own desires, which originate entirely from my heart. One of my life goals is to eliminate this pain.

To understand my desires, I must be true to myself, acknowledge that everything is natural and reasonable, never lie to myself, and accept who I am.

Interact with the world appropriately and find my own way to comfort and satisfy my desires.
