Hi there, Bitcoin hits 56k today and I'm here to introduce a way to buy Bitcoin or other major cryptos with relatively lower fees. I am just a newbie as well, you are welcome to tell me an even better approach to reduce the annoying fees.

I wanna mention that I do not recommend use Robinhood to trade crypto because you won't even get a wallet for the crypto you own.

Years ago, I used [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) to buy Bitcoin, apparently, it's the most convenient app for most people to buy crypto. But they also charge minimum of 1.49% fees for any buy/sell transactions, if your transaction amount is lower than $200, the expense ratio is even higher.

Easily we can switch to [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) which only charge you 0.50% if you are a new user. But 0.50% still sounds high, especially when most brokers charge 0 commission fees nowadays.

Then we found an awesome crypto exchange: [Binance.US](https://www.binance.us/en/home), they only charge you 0.10% fees for transactions as a new user, and if you buy a little amount of BNB (a crypto that was created by Binance) and pay you fees by BNB, you will get 0.75% discount which leads to equivalent 0.075% fees for transactions.

Let's do quick math to see how transaction fees can eat your profits: you deposit 10k to buy Bitcoin, and assume you sold it when the price of Bitcoin up 50%! Without any fees, here is how many profits you can keep at different exchange (round to the nearest integer):

| Exchange     | Transaction fees | Original Funds | Original value in Bitcoin | Final value in Bitcoin | Final funds | Profits | Percentages |
| ------------ |:----------------:|:--------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| Benchmark    | 0                | $10,000        | $10,000                   | $15,000                | $15,000     | $5,000  | 100%        |
| Coinbase     | 1.49%            | $10,000        | $9,851                    | $14,777                | $14,557     | $4,557  | 91%         |
| Coinbase Pro | 0.5%             | $10,000        | $9,950                    | $14,925                | $14,850     | $4,850  | 97%         |
| Binance.US   | 0.075%           | $10,000        | $9,993                    | $14,990                | $14,980     | $4,980  | 99.6%       |

Lower transaction fees can protect most your profits for even 1 transaction, if you seriously want to invest or trade crypto, I strongly recommend minimizing the transaction fee. But there is a problem about Binance.US: a new user can hardly deposit USD into the account. Here are the steps you can follow to bypass as much fees as possible:

- [Create a Coinbase/Coinbase Pro account](https://www.coinbase.com/join/liu_p8), link you bank account and deposit USD.
- Buy USDC (USD Coin) with USD with 0 fee, 1 USDC almost always worth 1 USD.
- [Create a Binance.US account](https://accounts.binance.us/en/register?ref=53283116), go to *Wallet* -> *Deposit*, find and copy your USDC wallet address.
- Go back to Coinbase, go to *Send/Receive*, paste your USDC wallet address from Binance.US and send all your USDC, **it will cost you few USDC as network fee**, this fee is paid to Ethereum (underlying infrastructure of USDC) and is irrelevant with how much USDC you sent, so you should send all your USDC at once.
- Once you received USDC in your Binance.US account, convert USDC to BUSD (Binance USD) with 0 fee, 1 USDC almost always worth 1 BUSD.
- Buy few BNB with BUSD as your transaction fees.
- Buy crypto you want with BUSD and enjoy the 0.075% transaction fees from now.

So this is the optimal path to reduce the transaction fees I found so far, hope this will help anyone who's new to investing crypto!
